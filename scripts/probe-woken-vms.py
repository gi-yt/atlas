# Probe whether each of the given Sleeping VMs has been WOKEN on the host — i.e.
# atlas-wake-trap.py (or an operator's local wake) removed its `sleeping` marker.
#
# The controller's reconcile_sleeping_vms() calls this per server every minute so a
# host-initiated (packet-triggered) wake is reflected back into the Frappe status
# within one poll cycle: the host is the authority for a wake HAVING happened (only
# it sees the inbound SYN); the controller just mirrors it into the DB. Read-only —
# it changes nothing on the host.
