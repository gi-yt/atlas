# Rebuild/Restore a Stopped VM's disk from a source, keeping its identity
# (name, IPv6, MAC, tap, SSH key). The source is either one of the VM's own
# snapshots (Restore) or a base image's pristine rootfs (Rebuild). Either way
# the VM keeps its UUID, so step 2's freshly-derived host keys / machine-id /
# hostname match the VM the operator already knows.
#
# The caller guarantees the VM is Stopped (the unit is down, rootfs unmounted),
# so swapping the file underneath it is safe. firecracker.json, network.env and
# the systemd unit already exist from the original provision and are untouched.
# Idempotent: re-running replaces the rootfs again with the same source.
#
# Inputs (environment variables):
#   VIRTUAL_MACHINE_NAME  - UUID; locates the VM directory and seeds identity
#   DISK_GB               - target rootfs size (the VM's current disk size)
#   VIRTUAL_MACHINE_IPV6  - injected into the rootfs network env
#   SSH_PUBLIC_KEY        - injected into authorized_keys
#   ATLAS_FC_UID          - per-VM uid; the rebuilt rootfs is chowned back to it
#   One source, exactly:
#     SNAPSHOT_ROOTFS_PATH  - absolute path to a snapshot rootfs (Restore), OR
#     IMAGE_NAME + ROOTFS_FILENAME - a base image under /var/lib/atlas/images (Rebuild)
