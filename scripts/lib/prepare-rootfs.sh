# Sourced library — NOT a standalone Task. Lives in scripts/lib/ so the

# Holds the rootfs preparation shared by provision-vm.sh, rebuild-vm.sh and the
# clone path: lay down a per-VM rootfs from a source (pristine image or a
# snapshot copy), resize it, and inject per-VM identity (SSH key, network env,
# hostname, swap, fresh host keys, machine-id). Each VM still gets unique
# identity even when the source bytes came from another VM's snapshot, because
# the host keys and machine-id are rewritten here from this VM's UUID.
