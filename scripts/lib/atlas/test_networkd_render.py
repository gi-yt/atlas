"""Unit tests for `networkd.render` — the canonical WgDesired renderer (spec
§16.2) + the §16.3 non-overlap invariant.

Run from `scripts/lib`: `python3 -m unittest atlas.test_networkd_render`. The
canonical bytes are asserted against the shape the existing
`atlas/atlas/host_mesh.py:render_wg_mesh_config` emits, so an ANCP-rendered
config byte-compares against one the controller last pushed on a host migrating
from the predecessor path.
