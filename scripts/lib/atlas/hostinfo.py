"""Host signature — is this host the one a warm snapshot was captured on?

A Firecracker memory snapshot is only restorable on a matching CPU model (CPUID
feature set), host kernel, and Firecracker build; Intel↔AMD is unsupported and
even same-size DigitalOcean droplets can differ (the Premium tier guarantees one
of the latest *two* CPU generations, and live migration can move a droplet to a
different physical host). So warm-snapshot-vm.py records this signature at
capture and vm-restore.py refuses to load when the live host's differs —
cold-booting instead, which is always correct.

The parse functions are pure (text in, dict out) so they unit-test with fixture
text on any machine; only `host_signature()` touches the live host (procfs,
uname, the firecracker binary).
