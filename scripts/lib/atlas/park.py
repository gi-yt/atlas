"""Host-side "parked" reachability for a Sleeping VM (spec/32-sleepy-vms.md).

When a VM sleeps, its unit stops and vm-network-down.py tears down ALL of its
host networking — the proxy-NDP entry, the /128 route, the netns/veth/tap, and
the per-VM forward rules — so the VM's public IPv6 is completely unrouted. That
frees the RAM (the whole point of sleep) but also means an inbound TCP connection
can never reach the host to trigger a wake.

Park restores the MINIMUM reachability needed to TRAP the first inbound TCP SYN,
with no running guest:

  - proxy-NDP for the /128 on the uplink, so the upstream router keeps delivering
    the VM's packets to this host (exactly as vm-network-up would);
  - a /128 route out a shared, always-up dummy interface (atlas-park0), so an
    inbound packet is FORWARDED (traverses `inet atlas forward`) instead of being
    input-delivered and consumed by the host — the same off-link trick the
    reserved-IP DNAT relies on ("must NOT be a local address … leaving it off-link
    is what lets the packet be forwarded", reserved_ip_nat.py);
  - one forward rule matching a connection-opening TCP SYN to the /128, with a
    named counter, that DROPs it:

        ip6 daddr <vm> tcp flags syn / fin,syn,rst,ack counter name wake_<hex> drop

    `tcp flags syn / fin,syn,rst,ack` is nft's mask/value form — it matches only a
    packet with SYN set and FIN/RST/ACK clear (a genuine new-connection SYN, not a
    SYN-ACK, not a mid-stream segment). `tcp flags` implies TCP, so ICMP (ping) and
    UDP never match: they fall through to the chain's `policy accept`, are forwarded
    out the dummy, and are silently discarded WITHOUT waking (the "TCP only"
    contract). The SYN is DROPped, not rejected, so the client's TCP stack
    retransmits after its RTO (~1s) — by then atlas-wake-trap.py has started the
    unit and the real path is live, so the retransmit reaches the resumed guest.

atlas-wake-trap.py (the always-on host daemon) polls the named counters and, on
the first packet for a still-sleeping VM, does the local wake (remove the marker,
start the unit). The started unit's vm-network-up.py calls unpark() FIRST, so the
rule + counter + dummy route are gone before the real forwarding path comes up.

A NAMED counter, not the anonymous `counter` the forward accept rules use: only
named counters appear in `nft list counters`, the flat, cheap surface the daemon
polls (no whole-chain parse). The name is `wake_<uuid-no-dashes>` — nft
identifiers forbid `-`, and the hex is a pure function of the UUID, so the
uuid<->counter map needs no stored state.

Pure argv/string construction except park() / unpark() / ensure_park_device(),
which touch the host; the builders are unit-testable with bare `python3 -m
unittest`, like firewall.py / reserved_ip_nat.py.
