"""Per-VM rootfs preparation — the successor to scripts/lib/prepare-rootfs.sh.

Shared by provision and rebuild: create a per-VM rootfs LV from a source (the
read-only base image LV, or a snapshot LV for clone/restore), grow it, give it a
fresh ext4 UUID, and inject this VM's identity (SSH key, network env, hostname,
swap, fresh host keys, machine-id). Each VM gets unique identity even when the
source blocks came from another VM's snapshot, because host keys and machine-id
are rewritten here from this VM's UUID.

The shell version used a `trap ... EXIT` to guarantee the mount is torn down on
any failure. Here that is a context manager (`_mounted`) — a try/finally the
type checker can see, instead of a trap a reader has to remember is armed.
