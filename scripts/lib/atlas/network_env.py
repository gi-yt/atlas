"""Typed reader for the per-VM network.env sidecar.

provision writes /var/lib/atlas/virtual-machines/<uuid>/network.env (a shell
KEY=value file) carrying the tap, addresses, netns, veth names, and per-VM uid.
The systemd hooks (vm-disk-up, vm-network-up/down) read it back instead of
consulting the Frappe DB — the host state is reconstructible from disk after a
reboot. The shell sourced it with `.` and guarded each var with `${VAR:?...}`.

Here that parse-and-guard is one typed object: read_network_env() parses the
file into a NetworkEnv, and .require()/.require_int() reproduce the shell's
fail-loud-on-missing semantics, naming the variable. Pure except for the file
read, so the parsing is unit-testable from a string with no host.
