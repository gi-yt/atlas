"""SWIM probe protocol (spec §14.2) — the failure-detection mechanism that
drives the `alive → suspect → dead` ladder in `failure.py`.

Every `probe_interval` (default 1 s), the daemon picks `probe_peers` (default
3) random members, sends each a direct `ping`. Acks received within
`probe_timeout` (default 500 ms) keep the peer `alive`. Acks received via K
indirect relays (default 3) within `indirect_timeout` (default 2 s) also keep
the peer `alive` (SWIM's indirect ping — a one-way partition between prober
and target doesn't false-evict if the prober can reach the target through a
	relay). No ack within `indirect_timeout` → `mark_suspect(target)` and the
suspect window opens (driven by `FailureTracker.gc` ticks that promote to
`dead` after `suspect_timeout`).

Refute (§14.2 paragraph 4): the target clears the suspicion by sending an
`alive` Membership Record at a higher Generation than the suspicing observer
	stored; the §10.3 monotonic apply rule accepts it, and a top-level trigger
	(from `gossip.handle_message` after applying any Membership update) calls
	`FailureTracker.note_alive(host_id)` to reset the ladder. Stage 4 wires
	the Trigger; Stage 5 formalizes the explicit fast-refute wire type if we
	need it for latency.

The wire types `TYPE_PING / TYPE_ACK / TYPE_INDIRECT_PING` are declared in
	`wire.py`; the payload helpers here are pure. The probe protocol is the
	only consumer of those types so the dispatch in `gossip.handle_message`
	routes them to `handle_ping` / `handle_ack` / `handle_indirect_ping` here.
