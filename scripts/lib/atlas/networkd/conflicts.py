"""Conflict detection + operator event hook (spec §7.3 / §18.2).

The conflict detector itself lives in `records.effective_ownership` — the
/128 in two origins' active sets goes to `OwnershipTable.conflicts` and is
dropped from routing. Stage 5 adds the operator-visible surface: every
conflict START and END emits an event the operator wires to alerting (the spec
deliberately leaves the alerting stack out — this module just emits).

A small file-based event sink at `/var/lib/atlas-networkd/conflicts.jsonl`
appends one JSON line per event (start / end) so an operator can `tail -F` it
locally or ship via their existing log pipeline. A process-in-memory hook
(`ConflictEvents.subscribe`) lets a test register a callback directly — used
by the test of the detector + the daemon's metrics counter.
