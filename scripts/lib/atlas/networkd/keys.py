"""WireGuard keypair on the host — controller-derived, host-generated fallback
(spec §7.1 / §8).

Storage: 32-byte Curve25519 private scalar at
`/etc/atlas-networkd/wg-private-key` (0600), base64-standard because that's
what `wg set private-key` reads. The public key (also base64) is stored
alongside at `wg-public-key` so the daemon can advertise it on its Membership
Record without re-running `wg pubkey` on every boot.

In the normal path the controller writes both files during bootstrap: it
derives the host's keypair with `networking.derive_host_wireguard_keypair`
(seed HMAC-keyed off the cluster-wide `ancp_wg_derivation_secret`, so the key
is NOT recomputable from the public Server UUID), and pushes them via the
root-SSH layer. `ensure_keypair` then finds the pushed pair valid and adopts
it verbatim — the derivation is stable, so a re-bootstrap re-derives the SAME
identity with zero peer churn, and `Server.wireguard_public_key` matches the
on-disk pub.

Only when those files are ABSENT (a host that came up before the controller
wrote them) does this self-generate a fresh keypair via `wg genkey` + `wg
pubkey` (guaranteed present on every Atlas host — the mesh already requires wg)
rather than pulling in `cryptography` (a Frappe dep, not a host dep) — matching
the spec's "few deps" operating principle (#5). A self-generated key won't
match the controller's derived `Server.wireguard_public_key`; the controller's
pushed pair is the canonical one.

`ensure_keypair(private_key_path, public_key_path)` is **idempotent**: if both
files exist with valid keys, it does nothing (adopts the controller's pushed
pair); otherwise it generates and writes. The systemd unit (Stage 1b) calls
this once before bring-up so the device-bring-up step can `wg set private-key`
against a real key.
