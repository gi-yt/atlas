"""`atlas-networkd` entry point (spec §9 + §14.4 + §16).

Stage 2: bring ``wg-mesh`` up peer-empty, install the bootstrap seed as
initial Membership Records, bind the ANCP UDP transport on the **public IPv6
endpoint** (not the wg-mesh /128), run the cold-join unicast
(``join.cold_join``) to every seed's public endpoint, apply the initial peer
table from the render pipeline, then enter the loop (scan + apply + gossip
fan-out + drain incoming + watchdog pat). On SIGTERM persist state + stop the
transport + sd_notify STOPPING.

ANCP rides plain UDP on public IPv6 addresses — the control plane is
independent of WireGuard (the *output* of the control plane, not its
transport).  This eliminates the bootstrap circular dependency entirely:
seeds' public endpoints and wg public keys are known from ``seed.json``, and
cold-join dials those endpoints directly without needing a wg-mesh peer entry
first.

The systemd unit ``scripts/systemd/atlas-networkd.service`` invokes this
module's ``main()`` under the Atlas venv, exactly like ``host-mesh.service``
invokes ``atlas.host_mesh.bring_up_mesh``.

The bootstrap contract (§8) is loaded eagerly: identity, keypair, and seed.
A missing identity or seed file fails loud (provisioning forgot to write it)
rather than coming up peer-empty with a fabricated identity (that would
pollute the cluster with a ghost).

This is the one module that touches the host system on the start path
(bring-up, periodic apply, UDP socket). Run with ``python3 -m
atlas.networkd.main`` for development; the ``sd_notify`` helpers short-circuit
when ``NOTIFY_SOCKET`` is absent so the daemon runs unchanged outside
systemd.
