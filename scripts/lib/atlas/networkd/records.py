"""Record types, generation semantics, and the effective-table computation
(spec §7). Pure: dataclasses + small functions, no I/O, no host touch.

Two record kinds exist:

- `MembershipRecord` (spec §7.1) — one per compute host, origin == host_id,
  mutated by the origin only (the §19 cross-origin forwarding ban). `kind` and
  `state` are the *origin's view* (alive/leaving / alive-suspect-dead as the
  origin asserts); the observer-local suspicion ladder (spec §14.1) is a
  separate field the observer keeps in `state.py`'s persisted view, never on the
  wire.

- `OwnershipAdvertisement` (spec §7.2) — a per-origin FULL SET of the /128s the
  origin currently owns. origin == owner_host always. Never a delta; removing a
  /128 is a later advertisement with a smaller set at a higher generation. No
  cross-origin generation comparison ever happens (Issue C close-out): the
  effective table is the union of the latest advertisement per origin, and a
  /128 in two origins' sets is the §7.3 conflict.

Generations are 64-bit unsigned, monotonic per-origin, persisted to disk so a
crash-restart does not reset them (spec §7.1, §13.4). We model them as a plain
`int` — the monotonicity invariant is enforced at apply time (spec §13.2), not
by the type.
