"""Wire format for ANCP messages (spec §13 / §9 / §19).

ANCP rides plain UDP on each host's public IPv6 endpoint, port 7946 (spec §5).
The implementation deliberately diverges from spec drafts that asserted
transport over wg-mesh — wg-mesh is the *output* of the control plane (the
data-plane device the daemon programs in §16), not its transport; ANCP must
bootstrap before the data plane it produces.

Stage 2 uses a JSON envelope: debuggable, easy to evolve, and small enough at
our record sizes that the encode/decode cost is irrelevant over a 200 ms gossip
tick. Binary is a §20 optimization held off until profiling proves it needs to
be — Taste.md's "don't import, copy" rule applies (no protobuf/cbor dep).

Envelope (spec §19.1):

    Message = {
      "type"               : "gossip" | "membership_advert" | "anti_entropy_req" | ...,
      "sender"             : HostID,                # the origin of this datagram
      "signing_public_key" : base64,                # the sender's ed25519 pubkey
      "payload"            : <type-specific JSON>,  # records, summaries, etc.
      "signature"          : base64,                # ed25519 over {type, sender,
                                                    #          signing_public_key, payload}
      "introduction_signature": base64 | omitted    # §19.5 newcomer cert (only the
                                                    # first MembershipAdvertisement
                                                    # from an unknown host_id)
    }

Datagram sizes are bounded by the IPv6 minimum MTU payload floor (1280 B); we
cap a serialized Gossip piggyback to fit that, dropping the tail when it would
overflow. Larger state transfers ride anti-entropy (§15, Stage 3) which can use
a multi-datagram or TCP exchange — gossip is the hot-path small-burst channel,
not the bulk channel.
