"""The main loop (spec §11.2 + §16.4 + §14.4). Pure scheduling on top of the
`Daemon`'s single-responsibility methods — kept tiny (< 10 lines per function)
so the timing invariants are visible at a glance.

    every tick (config.gossip_interval, default 200 ms):
        if scan due   → daemon.scan_local_ownership(); if changed → schedule apply
        if apply due (debounced by config.apply_debounce, default 200 ms) → apply
        pat the systemd watchdog (§: WATCHDOG=1, so `WatchdogSec=` relaunches a stuck daemon)

The loop has no host touch — every side-effect goes through `Daemon`'s injected
seams. `main.py` wires the signal handlers + sd_notify around this.

Stage 1b: only the scan + apply half of the loop is wired (no peer traffic yet).
The same loop, with the gossip/anti-entropy/probe handlers plugged in, is what
Stage 2 / 3 / 4 extend — this scheduling core is shared and unchanged.
