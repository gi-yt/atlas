-- stream_admin.lua — the TCP control path, unix-socket line-protocol server only
-- (spec/17-tcp-proxy.md § control plane).
--
-- The stream{} sibling of admin.lua. It exists as a SEPARATE admin surface
-- because http{} and stream{} lua_shared_dicts are separate address spaces: the
-- http admin (admin.lua, on /run/nginx/admin.sock) physically cannot write
-- the stream `ports` dict, so the TCP map needs its own admin server inside
-- stream{}, on its own socket /run/nginx/stream-admin.sock.
--
-- It speaks a minimal LINE PROTOCOL, not HTTP: the stream content phase reads raw
-- bytes off ngx.req.socket(), there is no parsed HTTP request, and a 3-verb line
-- protocol is less code than an HTTP parser and just as auditable:
--
--   GET\n                    -> the whole map as canonical JSON
--   SYNC\n<canonical-json>   -> bulk declarative replace (add + remove), then dump
--   DUMP\n                   -> force an immediate persist; reply "ok\n"
--   STAT\n                   -> {"entries":N,"last_dump":epoch|null} as JSON+\n —
--                              the L4 line-protocol analogue of the http admin's
--                              GET /healthz (no http listener exists in stream{}).
--
-- Reachable ONLY over the unix socket (nginx.conf binds it on a unix listener,
-- never TCP). Auth is the socket's file permissions: the only thing that can
-- reach it is a process inside the guest, and the only way Atlas gets there is
-- SSH-to-the-guest. No token — exactly like admin.lua.
