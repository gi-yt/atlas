# Build-shape release gate (proxy-stock-nginx-plus-compile.md §7). The companion
# test_proxy.py proves the proxy BEHAVES correctly (routing, sync, TLS, ws); this
# file proves the proxy is BUILT correctly — that the stack is genuinely "stock
# nginx from apt + our compiled dynamic modules", not a hand-rolled look-alike.
#
# These assertions are the safety net for the build.sh rewrite (custom all-source
# compile -> nginx.org apt base + dynamic modules). They run against the SAME
# running container test_proxy.py drives, so a green run here means the shipped
# guest snapshot has the same provenance.
#
# Run the stack first:  docker compose up --build -d
# Then:                 python3 -m pytest test_build.py -v
#
# Everything is introspected INSIDE the proxy container via `docker compose exec`
# (faithful to production: Atlas reaches the guest over SSH, never a host mount).
