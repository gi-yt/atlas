"""Rename `description` → `title` on `Virtual Machine`.

The DocType JSON in this commit ships the new field. Frappe's natural
migration step won't carry over the legacy column's values to a
differently-named new column — we do an in-place column rename via DDL
before the JSON-driven sync runs, so existing rows keep their labels.

Idempotent: re-running on an already-renamed table is a no-op.
