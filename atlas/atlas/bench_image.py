"""Golden bench image control plane — bake a bench-preinstalled image by building
INSIDE a plain guest over SSH, then snapshotting it.

This is the controller side of the golden bench image (spec/08-images.md). The
build itself — upload the committed `bench/` tree, run `build.sh` over guest-SSH
detached, record a Task, fail loud — is the shared `image_builder.run_build` seam;
`build_bench` is the thin wrapper that hands it the `bench` recipe
(`image_recipes.RECIPES["bench"]`). The full provision→build→stop→snapshot→register
lifecycle around it lives in the `Image Build` DocType.

That snapshot is the reusable "golden bench image" — a VM with bench-cli, the uv
venv, the Frappe clone, MariaDB + Redis, AND a fully-created site baked under the
fixed name `site.local`, so `deploy-site.py` (spec/14-self-serve.md) only RENAMES
that baked site to the per-VM FQDN (a directory move) + resets its admin password,
never paying the multi-minute `bench new-site` per signup.
