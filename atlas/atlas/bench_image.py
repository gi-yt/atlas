"""Golden bench image control plane — bake a bench-preinstalled image by building
INSIDE a plain guest over SSH, then snapshotting it.

This is the controller side of the golden bench image (spec/08-images.md). The
build itself — upload the committed `bench/` tree, run `build.sh` over guest-SSH
detached, record a Task, fail loud — is the shared `image_builder.run_build` seam;
`build_bench` is the thin wrapper that hands it the `bench` recipe — now a
back-compat alias `get_recipe("bench") → RECIPES["bench-v16"]` (the current line;
the single `bench` recipe split into versioned variants, image_recipes.py). The
full provision→build→stop→snapshot→register
lifecycle around it lives in the `Image Build` DocType.

That snapshot is the reusable "golden bench image" — a VM with bench-cli, the uv
venv, the Frappe clone, MariaDB + Redis, AND a fully-created site baked under the
fixed name `site.local`, so `deploy-site.py` (spec/14-self-serve.md) only RENAMES
that baked site to the per-VM FQDN (`bench rename-site`, which regenerates the nginx
vhost + re-runs production setup), never paying the multi-minute `bench new-site`
per signup.

# The in-guest sanity script. The assertions are printed on labelled lines we parse

# modes serve over DIFFERENT endpoints on the build VM:
#
#  SITE — over `:80` with the baked-site Host header (the build VM serves on
#  `site.local`; the FQDN rename happens only at deploy), the same contract build.sh's
#  own in-bake ping gate uses:
#   * SERVE   — `/api/method/ping` answers 200 + "pong". Production stack up + serving.
#   * LOGIN   — the BAKED Administrator password authenticates: 200 + "Logged In" + a
#               `sid` cookie. Catches a site that serves but whose baked password is
#               wrong/empty — the gap the unauthenticated ping gate misses.
#   * NEGCTL  — a WRONG password is rejected (401). Without it a login endpoint that
#               200s on anything passes LOGIN falsely; proves auth is real.
#
#  ADMIN — the admin console is the bench-cli admin Flask app on the INTERNAL admin
#  gunicorn at `127.0.0.1:(<[admin].port>+1)`. At bake time `[admin].domain` is UNSET
#  (deploy-site.py sets it per clone), so NO `:80` admin vhost exists yet — `:80` is
#  just the default nginx server. So we probe the internal admin port directly (no
#  Host header needed; the admin app answers any), reading `[admin].port` from the
#  guest bench.toml:
#   * SERVE   — `/api/status` on the admin gunicorn answers 200. Admin stack serving.
#   * ADMINUI — GET `/` on the admin gunicorn returns 200 AND the HTML carries the
#               `Bench Admin` console marker. /api/status can be 200 while the console
#               page is blank/broken (bad asset build, 500 template) — this asserts the
#               admin URL actually RENDERS, which is what a customer hits after deploy.
