"""Self-Managed TLS provider — operator drops PEMs at the configured paths.

The escape hatch for when Atlas should not run an ACME client: the operator
issues the wildcard cert out of band and places `fullchain.pem` / `privkey.pem`
at the cert paths themselves. `issue()` therefore acquires nothing — it asserts
the PEMs are already on disk and reads their validity window. Mirrors the compute
`SelfManagedProvider`, which echoes operator-supplied truth rather than calling a
vendor.
