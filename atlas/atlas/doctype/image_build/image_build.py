"""Image Build — the operator-facing object that bakes an image end to end.

One row per bake run. It owns the full lifecycle the two e2e modules used to
hand-roll: provision a scratch build VM → upload the recipe's committed tree and
run build.sh inside it over guest-SSH (the shared `image_builder.run_build` seam)
→ stop + snapshot → optionally register the snapshot into Atlas Settings and
terminate the build VM. The snapshot is the output; the build VM is scratch.

The lifecycle mirrors `Site` (spec/14): an immutable identity tuple guarded in
validate(), a controller-written `status` Select (read-only on the form),
after_insert() enqueues the run on `queue="long"` (it SSHes and waits ~10-20 min),
and each status transition is committed + pushed to the operator over realtime so
the desk form's checklist updates live. See spec/15-image-builder.md and
llm/image-builder-design.md.
