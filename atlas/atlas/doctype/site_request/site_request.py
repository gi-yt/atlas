"""Site Request — the pre-verification holding row (Contract C, spec/14-self-serve.md).

The whole point of this doctype is the *ordering*: a user signs up, we hold the
intent here, email them a link, and **only after they click it** do we create
the `User` and insert the `Site` (which provisions a billable VM). No droplet
work ever happens for an unverified email — verification is the gate.

```
signup → Site Request (Pending, token) → email link → verify → User + Site
                                                          (owner = verified user)
```

A `Site Request` is NOT a `Site`: it carries the intent + the verification state,
no VM and no routing. It enforces the same Contract-A label rules as `Site`
(shared `subdomain_label`), resolves the region the same way, and at fulfilment
hands off to `Site` for the authoritative uniqueness + the provision flow.
