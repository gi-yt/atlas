"""TCP proxy control plane — Atlas reconciles each proxy guest's live TCP port map
over SSH-to-the-guest (spec/17-tcp-proxy.md).

The exact mirror of `atlas/atlas/proxy.py`, for the L4 forwarder instead of the
HTTP reverse proxy. Atlas is the source of truth; each proxy VM's stream{}
`lua_shared_dict ports` is a cache (spec principle #2). This module builds the
desired regional port map from the `Port Mapping` rows, serializes it the SAME
canonical way the guest's stream_persist.lua does (so "in sync?" is a byte
compare — `canonical_json` is reused verbatim from `proxy.py`), SSHes into each
proxy guest, reads its live map off the stream-admin socket, and bulk-`SYNC`s the
full map on drift.

The differences from `proxy.py` are exactly two, both forced by the http/stream
lua_shared_dict isolation (a dict in http{} is invisible to stream{} Lua and vice
versa, so the TCP map needs its own admin surface inside stream{}):

1. The admin surface is a SECOND unix socket (`stream-admin.sock`) speaking a
   minimal LINE PROTOCOL (GET / SYNC / DUMP), not HTTP — so the guest transport is
   the stdlib `stream-admin` client build.sh installs, not `curl --unix-socket`.
2. There is no build verb (the TCP stream{} config + Lua are part of the SAME
   proxy/ tree and build.sh — a proxy is HTTP+TCP from one `build_proxy`) and no
   cert push (TCP forwarding is L4 passthrough; the proxy never terminates TLS).

Each guest operation is recorded as a Task row (`script` = `tcp-proxy-sync`, with
the proxy VM) for the operator's audit trail — the same row shape as `proxy-sync`.
