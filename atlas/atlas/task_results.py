"""Controller-side parser for a Task's typed result line.

Python tasks emit one `ATLAS_RESULT=<json>` line (see
scripts/lib/atlas/_task.py::TaskResult.emit). This is the controller half: pull
that line out of a Task's stdout and return the decoded dict. It replaces the
ad-hoc per-script stdout scraping the controllers used to do
(`_parse_size_bytes`, the bootstrap-json tail-line read).

The marker string is duplicated here intentionally: the emitting half lives in
the remote, stdlib-only `atlas` package (staged onto the host, never importable
by the Frappe app), so the two sides cannot share a module. The contract is one
constant; keep them in sync.
