"""Central-facing site provisioning — the entry point Central calls to create a
self-serve site for a tenant (spec/14-self-serve.md, spec/16-central.md).

Central owns end-users; it talks to Atlas as the operator (token auth as the
Central service user). It supplies *what* (the tenant it belongs to + the
subdomain label), never *where* — the region resolves from the active Root
Domain (Atlas Settings.region), and placement/clone are the Site controller's
concern. The insert's `after_insert` enqueues `auto_provision`, so the site
clones the golden bench, deploys, and routes itself.

This is the write half of the Central↔Atlas site contract; the read half is
`get_site` (poll) plus the `site.*` events Atlas pushes to Central
(atlas/atlas/central_report.py). There is no email, no User, no verification —
Central already authenticated the tenant.
