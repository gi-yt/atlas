"""Resolve a Virtual Machine to the bench/site front door that owns it.

Central mirrors VMs (the Asset), but the one-click login handoff — gateway_url,
login_url, its expiry — never lives on the pure-microVM `Virtual Machine`. It
lives on the tenant-owned aggregate that CREATED the VM: a `Pilot` (bench front
door) or a `Site` (self-serve site). Both were split off the VM for the same
reason and expose the same three handoff fields; this module is the single place
that, given a VM, finds whichever one backs it and reads the handoff uniformly.

The VM→front-door lookup was Pilot-only (`pilot_for_vm`), so a `create_site`
backing VM — owned by a Site, never a Pilot — surfaced as an Asset with no
login_url and a dead "Open". Resolving through EITHER aggregate fixes that
without merging the two DocTypes (spec/14-self-serve.md).

A `FrontDoor` normalizes the two shapes: `gateway_url` is `https://<fqdn>` for
both (the aggregate's name IS the fqdn), and the login handoff is surfaced only
once the aggregate is Running (before that the mint hasn't run — the same gate
the payloads already applied). A plain VM (proxy, operator machine) has no front
door → `front_door_for_vm` returns None and all three fields stay None, exactly
as before.
