"""Catalog of scripts that can be invoked as Tasks on a Server.

`allowed_scripts()` lists every script the SSH runner will execute on a host.
`operator_visible_scripts()` is the subset that the desk's Run Task dialog
exposes — anything that should only run from a VM/Image controller is
deliberately excluded.

`resolve()` is the file-system lookup used by the SSH runner; it searches both
the production scripts directory and the e2e test-only directory, because e2e
probe scripts (which never appear in the picker) need to be findable too.
