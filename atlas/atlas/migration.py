"""VM migration orchestration — the resumable phase machine and its callback.

See spec/24-vm-migration.md. This is the CONTROLLER-side driver; the host work
runs in the `migration-*` Task scripts (scripts/). Wired in hooks.py:

    scheduler_events = {"cron": {"*/2 * * * *": ["atlas.atlas.migration.reconcile_migrations"]}}

The design point: a migration is a sequence of idempotent host phases, each
recorded as the Migration row's `status`. `start_migration` (enqueued by
VirtualMachine.migrate on insert) is the migration's OWN driver: it runs one step
— a phase, or a single Hydrating poll — then re-enqueues itself to run the next,
looping until the row is terminal. So a migration walks Pending → … → CutoverStarting
(guest boots on the clone, DOWNTIME ENDS) → Hydrating(poll→…→100%, guest SERVING) →
CollapseClone → … → Done entirely on its own, self-pacing the long copy on the inline
SSH poll's round-trip, with no wait for a cron tick between steps. Boot-then-hydrate
(spec/24 §0) moved Hydrating AFTER CutoverStarting, so the copy overlaps uptime and is
off the downtime clock.

The `reconcile_migrations` cron is the SAFETY NET, not the driver — a dropped RQ
job, a provider rate-limit, an SSH blip, or a worker crash never strands a
migration, because the cron re-enters the recorded phase (idempotent) and every
phase resumes from the DB, never from in-memory state. (Historically the cron WAS
the Hydrating driver; the self-drive loop replaced that so a bench with the
scheduler off still finishes a migration.)

**Stage 1 (this build): change-address only.** The VM keeps its UUID (and every
host-local value derived from it) but gets a NEW public IPv6 on the target, and
the proxy/Subdomain layer is re-pointed to it. The keep-address paths (Scaleway
range-move §2, DigitalOcean permanent-forward §2.9) are later stages.

**Transport (this build): plain TCP.** The source binds `qemu-nbd` to its public
IPv4 and the target's `nbd-client` dials it directly — no SSH tunnel yet (the
host-to-host credential is a deferred stage-3 prerequisite, spec/24 §2.1). This
data path is unencrypted; it is a deliberate get-it-working-first shortcut.

Every phase obeys two rules:
  1. It runs its host work INLINE via run_task (not frappe.enqueue) — run_task
     saves the Task row first and raises on failure, and inline execution can't
     be a "lost worker job".
  2. It is idempotent: it checks "am I already done?" (the resume key) before
     acting, so re-entering a half-finished phase is safe.

	is collapsed only after hydration reaches 100% (CollapseClone).

	Order matters for keep-address (spec/24 §2.3): the forward path must be armed
	BEFORE the guest can serve, or the guest is up but black-holed. So:

	0. Private plane (spec/31 §16.3): withdraw the VM's private /128 from the SOURCE
	   host's ownership cache BEFORE provision-vm boots the target and starts
	   advertising the SAME /128. The /128 is host-independent (survives the move
	   byte-for-byte), so two hosts advertising it concurrently is the §7.3 conflict
	   — ANCP drops it from every host's wg-mesh AllowedIPs and the migrated VM's
	   private plane blackholes for the whole hydration window. Withdrawing first
	   keeps the two advertisements non-overlapping (§16.3 withdraw-from-source THEN
	   advertise-on-target). Safe here: the source VM is Stopped from Pending until
	   Cleanup (spec/24 §0.3), so the source stopped SERVING the /128 long ago — this
	   only stops it ADVERTISING; it does not blackhole a live source VM.
	1. keep-address only: `migration-target-receive` (return route) then
	   `migration-source-forward` (point the /128 at the tunnel + re-assert proxy-NDP).
	   Armed before boot so the first inbound packet is deliverable the instant the
	   guest is up.
	2. `provision-vm` with CLONE_ROOTFS_DEVICE set: boots the guest on
	   /dev/mapper/atlas-vm-<uuid>-clone. It does NOT re-inject (done in
	   InjectingIdentity through the clone), does NOT re-create the disk (the clone's
	   dest LV exists and is hydrating), and exposes the CLONE device as the jail
	   rootfs node. `--no-block` returns once the start is queued. Its ExecStartPre
	   (vm-network-up.py) ADD_LOCAL_OWNs the /128 on the target — the advertise that
	   step 0's withdraw must precede.
	3. Mark the VM Running + flip `server` to the target: the row now reflects
	   "live on target", stopping the downtime clock. (change-address Subdomain
	   re-point + reserved-IP handling stay in Repointing, off the clock.)

	Resume key: every step is idempotent — the source-withdraw is a no-op once the
	/128 is already out of the cache, the forward scripts re-assert, provision-vm
	re-exposes the same node + re-launches, and _finalize_cutover no-ops once the row
