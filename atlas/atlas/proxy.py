"""Proxy control plane — Atlas reconciles each proxy guest's live map (and pushes
the wildcard cert) over SSH-to-the-guest.

Atlas is the source of truth; each proxy VM's `lua_shared_dict` is a cache
(spec principle #2). This module is the controller side of the design's §7:
build the desired regional map from the `Subdomain` rows, serialize it the SAME
canonical way the guest's persist.lua does (so "in sync?" is a byte compare),
SSH into each proxy guest, read its live `/map` off the unix-socket admin API,
and bulk-`/sync` the full map on drift. Cert push uses the same guest-SSH path.

This is NOT a host Task (which stages a script onto a Server and runs it there):
it runs on the controller and SSHes *into the guest* (the second SSH target,
`connection_for_guest`). Each guest operation is still recorded as a Task row for
the operator's audit trail, with a synthetic script name (`proxy-sync` /
`proxy-push-cert`) and the proxy VM in `virtual_machine`.
