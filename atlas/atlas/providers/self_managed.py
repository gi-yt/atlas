"""Self-Managed provider implementation.

Self-Managed blurs the abstraction a little: Atlas itself owns the
truth, not a vendor. We keep the five-method shape so the worker doesn't
branch — `describe()` reads the Server row, `provision()` echoes back
what the operator typed, `destroy()` is a no-op.
