"""Controller side of the customer gateway (spec/25 Phase 5, spec/26).

A customer runs stock `wg-quick`, dials the region's GATEWAY VM's fixed public v4
`:51820`, and lands inside their tenant's /48 — reaching every VM in their VPC by
its stable `fdaa:` address. This module is the gateway VM's control plane, the
sibling of `atlas/atlas/proxy.py`:

  - `reconcile_gateway(gateway_vm)` renders the desired `[Peer]` set from the Active
    `VPN Peer` rows and `wg syncconf`s the gateway's single `wg0` over
    GUEST-SSH (the proxy idiom — the gateway is a guest, NOT the host-SSH mesh path),
    convergent + idempotent like `reconcile_proxy`.
  - `request_vpc_access` / `enroll_peer` / `revoke_peer` are the hot-path drivers a
    `VPN Peer` row calls: reconcile the gateway's wg0, then trigger a host-
    mesh reconcile so the client /128 is advertised (return path) / withdrawn.

TWO ISOLATION MECHANISMS, neither needing per-customer state (reference §6):
  1. SOURCE is pinned by WireGuard itself — each peer's host-side AllowedIPs is that
     customer's own client /128, so cryptokey routing drops (in-kernel, pre-nft) any
     packet whose inner source isn't that exact /128. A customer can't forge another
     tenant's source even sharing wg0 with thousands of others.
  2. DESTINATION is confined to the source's own /48 by a STATIC `same_48` eBPF guard
     baked onto the gateway's wg0 (host-side, `gateway-up.py`) — one program for ALL
     customers, never touched per enroll. Since the source is pinned to the client's
     own tenant, "same /48 as source" ≡ "the client's own VPC."

So enrolling a customer is JUST adding the wg peer with its /128 source pin — no new
interface, no new nft rule, no eBPF change. The gateway's shared `wg0` public key is
read from the gateway (one key per gateway) and denormed onto the row for the config
dialog; it is not per-row identity.
