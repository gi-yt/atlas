# Phase 5 e2e: SSH into a provisioned VM over its public IPv6 and prove the
# guest reaches the internet over BOTH families (spec/06-networking.md):
#
#   IPv4 egress (NAT44):
#   - eth0 has the derived private v4 (100.64.x.x/30)
#   - a v4 default route exists (via the tap's host side)
#   - the guest can reach a v4-ONLY destination (curl to an IPv4 literal,
#     which forces the v4 path and needs no DNS) — proves masquerade end to end
#
#   IPv6 egress (routed, public per-VM /128):
#   - the guest can reach a v6-ONLY destination (curl to an IPv6 literal,
#     which forces the v6 path and needs no DNS) — proves the routed-tap
#     egress and host forwarding end to end
#
# We hop in over IPv6 (the guest's only inbound path) and run both checks
# from inside the guest.
#
# Inputs:
#   VIRTUAL_MACHINE_IPV6  - destination address for the SSH hop.
#   SSH_PRIVATE_KEY       - private half of the key Atlas injected.
