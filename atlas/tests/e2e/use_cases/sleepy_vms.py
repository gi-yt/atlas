"""Use case: Sleepy VMs — idle VMs put to sleep, resumed on wake.

Exercises:
1. Auto-provision (insert -> Running)
2. vm.sleep() — memory snapshot + SLEEPING marker on host; status -> Sleeping
3. vm.start() from Sleeping delegates to wake() — status -> Running
4. Repeat stop/sleep to verify idempotency
5. Manual vm.wake() from Sleeping — status -> Running
6. Wake on the first inbound TCP SYN — the whole point of the feature, and the
   only part a tenant ever sees. Covered end to end: parked while asleep, ICMP
   does NOT wake, a TCP connect DOES, unparked afterwards, and the DB catches up.

Host facts checked:
- After sleep: sleeping marker file present, systemd unit inactive, /128 parked
  (named counter + SYN-drop rule + off-link route out atlas-park0)
- After wake: sleeping marker absent, unit active, VM SSH-reachable, unparked
