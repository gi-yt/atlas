"""Use case: the customer gateway (external dial-in to the tenant VPC).

Design: spec/25 Phase 5, spec/26, `llm/references/customer-vpc-vpn.md`. A customer
runs stock `wg-quick`, dials the region's GATEWAY VM's fixed public v4 :51820, and
lands inside their tenant's /48 — reaching every VM in their VPC by its stable `fdaa:`
address, while the gateway pins their source (WireGuard cryptokey routing) and confines
their destination to their own /48 (a static `same_48` eBPF guard on wg0 ingress).

This proves the host facts the unit suite (test_customer_gateway.py) can NOT reach —
the live wg0 + the eBPF guard's verdicts on a real deployed gateway (VPC-Phase A's one
remaining [HV], reference §11):

  run_smoke (structural, one host + a gateway VM, NO customer client):
    1. deploy_gateway stands wg0 up with the static same_48 guard attached (tc filter)
       + the host-local input drop, and mints the gateway's shared key.
    2. request_vpc_access enrolls a peer → wg0 carries it (pinned to the client /128).
    3. the client /128 is advertised into the host mesh (return path).
    4. revoke drops the peer from wg0 and withdraws the /128.

  run (the full L3 proof, TWO hosts + a real wg-quick "laptop" on host2):
    5. a real wg-quick client (host2 as the customer's premises) dials the gateway's v4
       and REACHES a same-tenant VM by its fdaa: address (the whole point).
    6. the client CANNOT reach a DIFFERENT-tenant VM (the same_48 drop — the negative
       is the point).
    7. the client CANNOT reach the gateway VM itself (the iifname wg0 input drop).

Invoked DIRECTLY (like host_mesh / migration), not folded into run_all_smoke:

    bench --site atlas.tests.local execute atlas.tests.e2e.use_cases.customer_gateway.run_smoke
    bench --site atlas.tests.local execute atlas.tests.e2e.use_cases.customer_gateway.run

Cost: run_smoke uses one host + one gateway VM; run adds a second host + two tenant VMs.
TEARDOWN (unless keep=True): revoke peers, terminate the gateway + VMs, tear the mesh down.
