# Golden bench image

The bake recipe for the **bench-preinstalled image** self-serve sites land on.
build.sh is the PROVEN recipe ([`../llm/references/bench-setup.md`](../llm/references/bench-setup.md))
and **nothing more**: it creates the `frappe` user, installs the ZFS userspace,
runs bench-cli's `install.sh`, drops the committed `bench.toml`, and runs
`bench init` + `bench start`. Because `bench.toml` sets `process_manager =
"systemd"`, **bench-cli itself stands up and manages the whole stack** — MariaDB,
Redis, nginx (with v6 listeners), and the bench processes — as lingering
`systemctl --user` units that survive reboot. So there is no hand-rolled
supervisord unit or nginx surgery here; that is all bench-cli's job now.

A freshly-provisioned VM from this image already has bench-cli, its uv venv, the
Frappe clone, MariaDB + Redis, nginx + the production stack **running and serving**
— so a snapshot-booted clone comes up answering on `:80` (v4 **and** v6) with no
deploy step. ERPNext is **opt-in** (`INCLUDE_ERPNEXT=1`): `get-app erpnext` +
`install-app` is by far the longest phase of the bake, and a Frappe-only golden is a
complete, serving bench.

**Two modes** (build.sh's first arg → two golden snapshots):

- **`site`** (default) — bakes a fully-created Frappe site under the
  fixed name `site.local`. `deploy-site.py` renames `sites/site.local` → the FQDN
  + `bench setup nginx`, so the **domain maps to the site URL** (Contract A: the
  on-disk name, the proxy `Host`, and the `Site` key are one string). The
  production gunicorn is multitenant (no `--site`), resolving `<fqdn>` from the
  `Host` per request with no restart.
- **`admin`** — bakes only the bench + the admin app (no site). `deploy-site.py`
  sets `[admin].domain = <fqdn>` + `bench setup nginx`, so the **domain maps to
  the admin URL** (nginx routes the FQDN to the socket-activated admin gunicorn).

The spec slice is [`../spec/08-images.md`](../spec/08-images.md) (§ golden bench
image); the self-serve flow it feeds is
[`../spec/14-self-serve.md`](../spec/14-self-serve.md).

**Pilot is installed the way its README documents** — `install.sh` off `develop`,
which lays down the **latest release** (prebuilt admin UI, no build step). Every
recipe bakes through that one path, site line and admin line alike, so a golden is
what an operator following pilot's README would get and a fresh environment needs no
pin bumped to work. The version is not pinned (install.sh's release path cannot be
asked for a specific release); the bake **records** what it got as
`ATLAS_BUILD_BENCH_CLI_REF` on the Image Build instead. `BENCH_CLI_REPO`/
`BENCH_CLI_REF` still exist to bake off a fork or an older release.

**MariaDB.** `bench init` provisions ONE rootless, **user-owned
`pilot-mariadb.service`** shared by the host's benches, with its datadir and socket
under `~/pilot/databases/mariadb/` and unix_socket auth for the bench user. It is a
`systemctl --user` unit like the rest of the stack, so lingering is what brings it
back at boot. `bench/deploy-site.py` gates every deploy on that socket accepting a
connection (`DB_SOCKET`) rather than on any unit name, so it works against any pin
(an older fork provisioned a dedicated system `mariadb@atlas` instead — the shape the
committed `bench.toml`'s now-inert `[mariadb]` table describes).

**ZFS — no current reader.** Upstream pilot has no volume schema at all, so the
`[volume]` tables are inert on every golden and the bench + DB live on the plain
rootfs. build.sh still installs the ZFS **userspace** (`zfsutils-linux`) so the pair
with the baked `zfs.ko` stays intact for a volume-aware pin; the module itself is
baked into the guest rootfs at image-sync time, so build.sh never DKMS-builds
anything. (Cold-boot ZFS auto-import/mount-ordering is not wired here.)

**The golden image is a VM snapshot**, not a from-URL `Virtual Machine Image`.
It is built *inside* a plain Ubuntu VM (this directory's `build.sh`, run over
SSH) and the built VM is snapshotted — that snapshot is the reusable image, the
same build-in-guest + snapshot pattern the proxy uses (`proxy/build.sh` →
`Virtual Machine.snapshot`). There is no chroot bake at sync time: apt's
MariaDB/Redis postinst run normally in a real booted guest, not in a rootfs the
host never boots.

## Layout

```
bench.toml      committed bench config — pins Frappe (version-16), the systemd
                [production] process manager, nginx :80 serving (http_port = 80),
                and the admin app. Its `[mariadb]` + `[volume]` tables are inert
                (upstream pilot declares neither); see bench.toml.md
build.sh        the PROVEN recipe, nothing more: fix setuid bits; install the ZFS
                userspace; create the frappe user (+ NOPASSWD sudo);
                pilot install.sh, the documented way; `bench new` + drop bench.toml;
                `bench init` + `bench start` (run AS frappe). Site mode also bakes
                a `site.local` ERPNext site. Takes `[site|admin]` as the first arg
warm.sh         arm the build VM for a WARM snapshot capture — install the freshen
                unit, pre-warm the (already-running) stack with localhost HTTP, and
                sync. Run after build.sh, before freeze. The only per-clone deploy
                work on a warm resume is `mv` + `bench setup nginx`
deploy-site.py  per-VM deploy, run IN A CLONE over guest-SSH by
                atlas.atlas.deploy_site (AS frappe): site mode RENAMEs
                `sites/site.local` → the FQDN; admin mode sets `[admin].domain`;
                both then `bench setup nginx` + reload — no admin reset, no restart
bench-domain-provider.py
                the in-guest domain provider (spec/18 Component D), installed at
                /usr/local/bin/bench-domain-provider — the plug-in pilot (formerly
                bench-cli) discovers on PATH and drives by exit-code + stdout JSON.
                One-way push: `register <domain>` (BEFORE `bench new-site`) reserves
                the name; `deregister <domain>` (after drop / as rollback) removes it;
                `wildcard-domains` / `proxy-servers` answer host-level queries.
                build.sh installs it AFTER its own `bench new-site site.local` — pilot
                gates register + the wildcard name-check on the binary being on PATH, and
                `site.local` matches no region wildcard, so a provider present at bake
                would reject the baked site. Deferring the install lets the bake skip it.
                Stdlib-only, IPv6-only, no-ops with no routing config

## Self-service subdomain routing (the `bench-domain-provider` plug-in)

A bench owner can `bench new-site <label>.<region>.frappe.dev` from inside the
guest; spec/18 makes that site routable through the regional proxy with no operator
action. The model is **one-way push**: the guest *tells* the controller what changed
(it never reads the guest back — no pull, no sweeper), and the controller stays the
single authoritative writer of the fleet-wide-unique `Subdomain` table, arbitrating
every write (uniqueness, brand denylist, per-VM cap, own-VM scoping).

`bench-domain-provider` is the **process-I/O plug-in** pilot looks up on `PATH` and
calls per verb, reading only its **exit code + stdout JSON** (pilot's
`docs/domain-provider.md`). It replaced the old `atlas-route` client (which pilot
*imported* as a typed Python surface): the boundary is now process I/O, the verbs take a
**full FQDN** (the binary peels the region wildcard suffix to the bare label the
controller arbitrates), and `register` is **fail-closed**.

- `bench-domain-provider register <domain>` — POSTs the controller's `register`, the
  AUTHORITATIVE reservation, run **before** `bench new-site`. **Exit 0** on ok; **exit 2**
  on taken / reserved / at_limit / invalid **or a name not under the wildcard** (so pilot
  ABORTS before creating the local site — block-at-create by ordering, no orphan); **exit
  1** on a transport failure (**fail-closed** — pilot aborts the create). NotConfigured →
  exit 0 (not an Atlas bench).
- `bench-domain-provider deregister <domain>` — POSTs `deregister`, best-effort, ALWAYS
  exit 0. Fired after `bench drop-site` AND as the rollback when `bench new-site` fails.
- `bench-domain-provider generate-dns-records <site> <domain>` — pre-flight, read-only;
  prints `{}` for a wildcard subdomain (no user records needed). The custom-domain record
  recipe is Phase 2.
- `bench-domain-provider wildcard-domains` — host-level: prints `["*.<region>.frappe.dev"]`
  (the names pilot constrains sites to). Fail-soft.
- `bench-domain-provider proxy-servers` — host-level: prints the regional proxy fleet's
  public IPs; pilot locks its nginx down to them (`allow … ; deny all;`) and trusts their
  XFF. Fail-soft. Closes the spec/18 trust-root gap (which edge the bench should trust).

**Caller resolution is by source address** — the binary carries NO VM-identifying
argument and POSTs over **IPv6** (the controller resolves the VM from the request's
v6 source `/128`; a v4 POST has no per-VM source). It reads ONE **non-secret** file
the controller injects (cold path: `rootfs.inject_identity`; warm path: the MMDS
payload + `atlas-warm-freshen.py`): `/etc/atlas-routing.env` (`ATLAS_BASE_URL=…`, the
trusted-edge FQDN). No UUID, no token. With no `/etc/atlas-routing.env` the binary
no-ops (register exits 0, the queries print blank), so a non-Atlas bench is unaffected.

**pilot integration** (the moving dependency `build.sh` pins): pilot's `new_site` runs
`bench-domain-provider register <domain>` **before** it creates the site and aborts on a
non-zero exit; `drop_site` (and `new_site` on failure) runs `deregister <domain>`;
`setup-nginx` reads `proxy-servers` to lock the edge, and the Add-Domain UI reads
`wildcard-domains`. That wiring is gated on `/usr/local/bin/bench-domain-provider` being
present, so an ordinary bench (no provider installed) behaves exactly as before. The
contract is the exit-code + stdout-JSON boundary, **not** a typed Python surface.

## Serving model (how a clone answers the proxy)

The golden boots with the production stack already running and serving — bench-cli's
lingering `systemctl --user` units (enabled by `bench start` under
`process_manager = "systemd"`, with `loginctl enable-linger frappe`) bring the
bench, MariaDB, Redis, and nginx up at boot. The production
gunicorn is **multitenant** — `frappe.app:application` runs with no fixed `--site`,
so it resolves the site from the request `Host` header **per request**
(`get_site_name`), with nothing cached at boot. When a `Site` is created the
controller clones the snapshot and runs `deploy-site.py` in the clone
([`../spec/14-self-serve.md`](../spec/14-self-serve.md)) to do the one per-VM thing
the image can't bake — give the FQDN its identity on disk:

**Site mode:**

1. **Rename** `sites/site.local` → `sites/<fqdn>` (Contract A — the on-disk name
   now equals the proxy `Host` and the `Site` key). Atomic, sub-millisecond. The
   multitenant gunicorn then resolves `<fqdn>` from the `Host` per request with NO
   restart.
2. **`bench setup nginx`** (NOT `setup production`) — regenerate the vhost: it
   scans `sites/`, finds the renamed dir, emits `server_name <fqdn>` (on `listen
   80;` + `listen [::]:80;`, both emitted by bench-cli) + a
   `root .../sites/<fqdn>/public` files block, then reloads nginx. Pure config-gen,
   no Frappe boot, no process restart.

**Admin mode:** set `[admin].domain = <fqdn>` in bench.toml + `bench setup nginx`,
which emits the `_admin.conf` vhost (`server_name <fqdn>` → the socket-activated
admin gunicorn). No site rename.

A **cold clone** (snapshot-booted) idempotently re-asserts `bench start` first; a
**warm clone** (resumed from a memory snapshot) is already serving and skips it.

There is **no `set-admin-password`** — the owner is handed the shared baked
throwaway and rotates it after first login (the per-VM reset cost a ~28s
CPU-throttled `bench frappe` boot that dominated the deploy). The slow `bench
new-site` + `install-app erpnext` are paid once at bake time, not per signup.

The edge proxy (spec/12) routes `Host: acme.blr1.frappe.dev` → `[<vm-v6>]:80`,
where this nginx answers via the `server_name <fqdn>` vhost. **TLS terminates at
the edge proxy, not here** — there is no in-guest certbot. The `Site` flips to
Running only on an observed HTTP 200 from that `:80` (Contract B;
`atlas.atlas.deploy_site.wait_for_http`).

## How it's built

1. Provision a plain `ubuntu-24.04` VM (any server in the region).
2. `atlas.atlas.bench_image.build_bench(<vm>)` uploads this tree and runs
   `build.sh` over guest-SSH (mirrors `atlas.atlas.proxy.build_proxy`).
3. Stop the VM and `Virtual Machine.snapshot(...)` it.
4. Register the snapshot as the golden image (clone source for new site VMs).

See [`../atlas/tests/e2e/use_cases/bench_image.py`](../atlas/tests/e2e/use_cases/bench_image.py)
for the operator action that drives all four steps end to end.
