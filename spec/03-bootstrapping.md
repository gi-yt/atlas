# Bootstrapping a server

A server starts as a vanilla Ubuntu host. Ubuntu 24.04 is the supported
target (this is what the DigitalOcean image gives us). Ubuntu 26.04 is
known to work on Self-Managed hosts but is not part of the regression
suite; if the bootstrap script breaks on 26.04, it is a bug we will fix.
Bootstrap is the task that turns whatever Ubuntu the operator gave us
into a Firecracker host.

## The script

There is one script:
[`atlas/scripts/bootstrap-server.py`](../scripts/bootstrap-server.py). It does
everything in a single SSH session. It is the canonical artifact — the spec
is a reading guide, not the source of truth. If the script and this document
disagree, the script wins. Update both. Like every task it is a typed Python
program (see [04-tasks.md § Tasks are Python](./04-tasks.md)): its inputs are
`--kebab-case` CLI flags and it emits one `ATLAS_RESULT=` JSON line carrying the
host facts the controller records.

### Inputs (CLI flags)

The controller's `variables` dict (UPPER_SNAKE keys) is rendered to
`--kebab-case` flags by the runner, parsed by `BootstrapInputs.from_args()`.

| Variable / flag                            | Notes                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `FIRECRACKER_VERSION` → `--firecracker-version` | Pinned in `atlas/atlas/doctype/server/server.py`, currently `v1.16.0`. Inventory of all pins: [spec/23-supply-chain.md](23-supply-chain.md). |
| `ARCHITECTURE` → `--architecture`          | `x86_64` for this iteration.       |
| `SSHPIPER_VERSION` → `--sshpiper-version` | Pinned in `Server.bootstrap()`, currently `v1.5.4`. |
| `ATLAS_URL` → `--atlas-url` | Base URL of the Atlas site, passed to the SSHPiper plugin. |
| `SSHPIPER_LOOKUP_SERVER` → `--sshpiper-lookup-server` | This Server row's UUID; scopes the host-side lookup token. |
| `SSHPIPER_API_KEY` → `--sshpiper-api-key` | Per-server lookup token stored on `Server.sshpiper_api_key` and written to the host env file. |

### What the script does

Read the file. It is ~250 lines.

In summary, in this order:

1. Verifies architecture matches and `/dev/kvm` is readable+writable.
2. Waits for the apt locks to clear, then installs `ca-certificates`,
   `curl`, `e2fsprogs`, `iproute2`, `jq`, `lvm2`, `nftables`,
   `squashfs-tools`, `thin-provisioning-tools`.
   A freshly-booted cloud image still has cloud-init / unattended-upgrades
   running its own `apt-get` for the first minutes, holding the apt locks;
   the script blocks on `cloud-init status --wait` and then polls the
   apt/dpkg lock files (capped) before touching apt. Without this, the very
   first `apt-get update` raced cloud-init and failed with
   "Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock", landing fresh droplets in
   `Broken`. (apt's `DPkg::Lock::Timeout` is set too, but it does not cover
   the `apt-get update` *lists* lock on this apt version, so the explicit
   wait is the load-bearing fix.)
3. Installs Firecracker **and the jailer** at `/usr/local/bin/{firecracker,jailer}`
   if either is missing or not at the pinned version. Both ship in the same
   release tarball, so this is one download. Production runs every VM under the
   jailer; a host bootstrapped before the jailer existed picks it up on re-run
   (the gate checks both binaries).
4. Installs SSHPiper and the Atlas SSHPiper plugin, writes
   `/etc/default/sshpiper` with the Atlas URL, this Server UUID, and the
   per-server lookup token, and enables `sshpiper.service`. Port 22 is public VM
   SSH ingress; host SSH moves to 222. See [23-sshpiper.md](./23-sshpiper.md)
   for the lookup and auth contract.
5. Writes `/etc/sysctl.d/60-atlas.conf` with IPv6 forwarding, proxy NDP, and
   IPv4 forwarding (`net.ipv4.ip_forward`, for NAT44 egress), **plus the
   CIS 3.3 network-hardening sysctls** — see *Host hardening* below.
6. Writes the sshd hardening drop-in, the kernel-module blocklist, enables
   unattended security updates, and disables KSM/swap — see *Host hardening*.
7. Creates the `inet atlas` nftables table with a `forward` chain (IPv6
   filter) and a `postrouting` chain holding the host-wide IPv4 masquerade
   rule. See [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md).
8. Creates the `/var/lib/atlas/` directory tree.
9. Creates the **LVM thin pool** that backs every VM disk: loads `dm_thin_pool`
   (persisted via `/etc/modules-load.d/60-atlas-lvm.conf`), then runs the
   idempotent `atlas_pool_ensure` — a sparse backing file at
   `/var/lib/atlas/pool/atlas-pool.img`, a loop device over it, a PV/VG
   (`atlas`), and a thin pool LV (`pool0`, with an explicit
   `--poolmetadatasize 1G`). The PV is a **loopback file** because a stock
   droplet has no spare block device; the only line that changes for a real
   attached device (the spec/09 follow-on) is the loop binding. Bootstrap is
   **not** re-run on reboot, so it also enables `atlas-pool.service` — a oneshot
   that imports the durable package (`from atlas.lvm import ThinPool`) and calls
   `ThinPool().ensure()` to re-assert the pool's loop device on boot, ordered
   before the VM units. See [07-filesystem-layout.md](./07-filesystem-layout.md).
10. **Reads the Atlas virtualenv's python version** for the bootstrap log. The
   venv itself is *already created* by [`scripts/install.sh`](../scripts/install.sh),
   which the controller runs over SSH **before** this Task (right after the upload);
   it installs `uv`, creates a uv-managed virtualenv on CPython 3.14 at
   `/var/lib/atlas/venv`, `uv pip install`s the `atlas` package into it, generates
   the `atlas` console script (symlinked onto `PATH`), and runs the deep sanity
   gate. So by the time `bootstrap-server` runs — itself as `atlas bootstrap-server`
   on that venv — the interpreter every other Task and every VM-boot hook uses is
   already proven. See *The Atlas interpreter and CLI* below.
11. Writes `FIRECRACKER_VERSION`, `JAILER_VERSION`, `KERNEL_VERSION`,
   `ARCHITECTURE`, and `PYTHON_VERSION` to `/var/lib/atlas/bootstrap.json` (the
   single source of truth) and `cat`s it on stdout. `firecracker_version` and
   `jailer_version` are always the same (one tarball) but both are recorded on
   the `Server` row. `python_version` is the resolved Atlas venv python; it is
   carried for visibility in the bootstrap log but **not** persisted to a Server
   field (it is derived state — see below).

The Python side `json.loads` the trailing JSON object and writes the
fields onto the `Server` document. `jq` is invoked with `-nc` (compact,
single-line) so the trailing line is a single object; the parser scans
backwards for the last non-empty line.

### The Atlas interpreter and CLI

A managed host ships whatever `python3` its Ubuntu gave it (24.04 = 3.12); the
controller runs 3.14. Rather than gamble on the host's stock interpreter,
bootstrap installs Atlas's host code **the standard way** — a uv-managed
virtualenv with the package `uv pip install`ed into it — so the controller and
its hosts run the same CPython no matter what Ubuntu shipped. The same install
produces the `atlas` console command for an operator.

**The interpreter — a uv-managed venv, created by `install.sh`.** `uv` is an
ordinary host tool here. The venv is created by
[`scripts/install.sh`](../scripts/install.sh) — a small POSIX-sh script the
controller runs over SSH as the **first step of `Server.bootstrap()`, right after
the upload** and *before* the bootstrap Task. It:

- installs the pinned `uv` to `/var/lib/atlas/uv` (the one network fetch),
- creates a virtualenv on a uv-controlled CPython 3.14 at `/var/lib/atlas/venv`
  (`uv venv --python 3.14`; uv fetches the interpreter if absent, kept under the
  single `/var/lib/atlas/uv` tree), and
- `uv pip install`s the `atlas` package into it from the durable tree the caller
  already placed at `/var/lib/atlas/bin` (which carries a `pyproject.toml` for
  exactly this — see *Files that must already be on the server* below),
- symlinks the generated `atlas` console script onto `PATH` at `/usr/local/bin`.

`install.sh` is the **single source of truth for `UV_VERSION` / `PY_VERSION`**
(they moved out of `bootstrap-server.py`). It is **not** a code-transport
mechanism — the package is already on the host; install.sh only creates the
interpreter. It is idempotent (`uv pip install --reinstall`), so a code edit
reaches the host on the next `bootstrap` — the same single refresh point the
durable scripts already use.

The boot hooks invoke `/var/lib/atlas/venv/bin/python` (the host-side
`atlas.paths.ATLAS_PYTHON`); the runner invokes each Python verb as the
pip-installed `atlas <verb>` console script (same venv interpreter, reached by
name on `PATH`).

- **No carve-out.** Because install.sh creates the venv + console script *before*
  the bootstrap Task, `bootstrap-server` is an ordinary Python verb — it runs as
  `atlas bootstrap-server` on the venv python like every other verb. There is no
  stock-`python3` branch in the runner and no narrow CI gate keeping one script
  parseable on Ubuntu's 3.12: nothing host-side touches the stock interpreter, so
  the floor is 3.14 everywhere.
- **Deep sanity gate (the safety):** before it returns, install.sh proves the venv
  python actually runs what the units will run — not just `import atlas`, but the
  `from atlas.lvm import ThinPool` that `atlas-pool.service` does, a `py_compile`
  of all four boot hooks, and that the `atlas` console script dispatches
  (`atlas --help`). A broken venv fails the install *here* — before the bootstrap
  Task runs and before the units are pointed at it, so a unit never points at a
  missing or broken `/var/lib/atlas/venv`. (For a **Fake** server there is no host,
  so the install.sh SSH step is skipped exactly as the upload is.)
- **CLI-readiness is persisted once, here.** A succeeded bootstrap (the gate
  passed) sets `Server.cli_ready = 1`. This replaces the old per-Task
  `test -e /var/lib/atlas/venv/bin/python` round trip the runner used to make
  before every Python Task: the fail-fast moved from once-per-Task to
  once-at-bootstrap. A legacy/unbootstrapped host has `cli_ready = 0` — the
  operator-facing "re-bootstrap this server" signal — and a stale host with no
  `atlas` on `PATH` simply fails its Task with `atlas: command not found`.
- **`python_version` is derived state, not a Server field.**
  `/var/lib/atlas/venv/bin/python --version` on the host and install.sh's
  `PY_VERSION` constant are both live truth; persisting a copy on the `Server`
  row would only drift. It rides the bootstrap log for visibility and nothing
  reads it back.
- **Migration of a running fleet:** a re-bootstrap rewrites the unit files +
  `daemon-reload`, but a *running* `firecracker-vm@<uuid>` keeps its
  already-loaded `ExecStart` until restarted, so the swap takes effect on the
  next start/restart of each VM. `Restart=always` and the host-reboot LV
  re-activation are **not** a grace period — they run the swapped hooks the
  instant after `daemon-reload`; the sanity gate is what de-risks that (the venv
  is proven-good before any unit points at it).

**The `atlas` CLI.** The same `uv pip install` materialises the `atlas` console
script in the venv (the package's `pyproject.toml` declares
`atlas = "atlas._cli:main"` under `[project.scripts]` — the conventional way to
ship a Python CLI). Bootstrap symlinks it onto `PATH` at `/usr/local/bin/atlas`,
so an operator on a host has one front door: `atlas stop-vm
--virtual-machine-name <uuid>`, `atlas --help` lists every command. It is **both**
the break-glass / debug face for an operator AND the runner's execution entry —
the controller drives the normal path over SSH as `atlas <verb> --flags`, the
exact same typed entry points, exposed by name. (See
[04-tasks.md § Tasks are Python](./04-tasks.md) and
[`scripts/lib/atlas/_cli.py`](../scripts/lib/atlas/_cli.py).)

The dispatcher discovers its commands from the durable entry scripts at
`/var/lib/atlas/bin` (where bootstrap placed them); the four systemd hooks are
excluded by construction (positional-uuid, no typed inputs — not hand-runnable).

The CLI's grammar is delivered in **two phases, deliberately isolated** so a
grammar change can never be confused with an install/packaging regression:

- **Phase 1 (this) — install the scripts *as-is*, and execute through them.** The
  verbs are exactly the script stems: `atlas stop-vm`, `atlas resize-vm`,
  `atlas snapshot-vm`. No grammar change, no new flags — `atlas <stem> <flags>`
  parses to the identical typed inputs as running the bare script, so the CLI
  adds zero logic. The runner now invokes every Python verb this way (it no longer
  shells `python3 <path>`), and `Task.script` stores the bare verb.
- **Phase 2 (later, explicit) — a natural grammar.** `atlas vm stop`,
  `atlas vm resize`, etc. — a verb/noun shape layered over the same dispatch.
  Done as its own change once Phase 1 is proven; **not** in scope here.

- **Controller-only scripts** (`issue-cert`, `tunnel-*`, `mgmt-firewall-*`) are
  a separate question deferred to Phase 2: they run on the *controller*, not a
  host, so the right end state is likely the same `atlas` CLI installed on the
  controller too (`atlas mgmt-firewall-apply …` run where it belongs). Until
  then the host CLI's command set and the host-SSH catalog
  (`scripts_catalog.allowed_scripts()`) are **not** asserted equal — see the
  note in [04-tasks.md](./04-tasks.md).

### Host hardening

Bootstrap hardens the host as part of the same idempotent script. The
controls are a cherry-picked subset of the **Firecracker production-host
setup** doc and the **CIS Ubuntu 24.04 / CIS Distribution-Independent
Linux** benchmarks — chosen because they reduce real attack surface on a
microVM host without breaking it, and skipping everything that is box-ticking
for a headless, key-only-root, machine-controlled host (no PAM/password
policy, no AIDE, no auditd, no login banners, no service-disable sweep). All
controls are expressed as `*.d` drop-in files (sysctl.d, sshd_config.d,
modprobe.d, apt.conf.d) so they are idempotent overwrites and portable across
Ubuntu 24.04 and 26.04 — we never invoke a release-pinned hardening tool.

The hardening is **not** a separate operation, button, or Task: it is part of
`bootstrap-server.py`, re-applied (as a no-op) on every re-bootstrap.

| Control | What | Benchmark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network sysctls | reject ICMP redirects, no source routing, no redirect-send, log martians, bogus/broadcast ICMP ignored, SYN cookies, IPv6 `accept_ra=0` — all in `/etc/sysctl.d/60-atlas.conf` alongside the forwarding lines | CIS 3.3.2–3.3.11 |
| sshd drop-in | `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-atlas.conf`: key-only root, no password/empty-password/keyboard-interactive auth, `MaxAuthTries 4`, `LoginGraceTime 60`, `ClientAlive 300×3`, modern Ciphers/MACs/KexAlgorithms. Validated with `sshd -t` **before** reload so a bad drop-in can never brick SSH | CIS 5.1 |
| Module blocklist | `/etc/modprobe.d/60-atlas-blocklist.conf`: unused filesystem modules (`cramfs`, `freevxfs`, `hfs`, `hfsplus`, `jffs2`, `udf`, `usb-storage`) and unused network protocols (`dccp`, `tipc`, `rds`, `sctp`). It must **never** list a load-bearing module — `tun`/`tap` (VM taps), `kvm`/`kvm_intel`/`kvm_amd` (Firecracker), `vhost`/`vhost_net` (virtio), `nf_tables`/`nft_*` (firewall), `dm_mod`/`dm_thin_pool` (the thin-pool VM-disk backend); CIS only blocklists *unused* modules, so none of these appear, but the e2e probe asserts it. | CIS 1.1.1, 3.2 |
| Security updates | install `unattended-upgrades`, scoped to the **security** pocket only, **no** automatic reboot (a reboot would kill running VMs) | CIS 1.2.2.1 |
| KSM / swap off | disable Kernel Samepage Merging (cross-VM memory side channel) and swap (guest RAM remanence on disk) | Firecracker prod-host |
| Guest IMDS-drop | one host-wide nft rule (`inet atlas forward: ip daddr 169.254.169.254 drop`) so a guest cannot reach the host's cloud metadata endpoint (the droplet's own userdata / vendor credentials). Firecracker does no egress filtering, so the host must. The guest's own MMDS lives at the same address but is served on the tap inside the netns and never crosses this chain. See [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md). | Firecracker prod-host |
| FC log rotation | `/etc/logrotate.d/60-atlas-firecracker` bounds the per-VM `firecracker.log` (a guest can influence log volume; the systemd unit `append:`s it unbounded). `copytruncate` because systemd holds the file open with no reopen signal. | Firecracker prod-host |

#### Deliberate deviations

Three benchmark items are **intentionally not applied** because they would
break Atlas. A CIS audit will flag these three as failures — they are
deliberate, documented here, and asserted by the e2e probe so they cannot
silently regress:

1. **IP forwarding stays on** (CIS 3.3.1 says disable it). The VM networking
   model is a routed-tap topology — there is no bridge; the host routes packets
   between its uplink and each per-VM tap, which *is* IP forwarding. With it
   off, every VM is unreachable in both directions. Blast radius is contained at
   the `inet atlas` nftables forward chain, not at the global switch. See
   [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md).
2. **`squashfs` is not blocklisted** (CIS 1.1.1.7 says blocklist it). `unsquashfs`
   unpacks the rootfs image at sync time; blocklisting the module would break
   image sync. The rest of the CIS module blocklist is applied.
3. **`PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`** (CIS 5.1.20 says `no`). Atlas connects
   as root over SSH with a key; there is no unprivileged user yet (that is a
   [roadmap](./09-roadmap.md) item). `no` would lock Atlas out of every server.
   `prohibit-password` is the CIS-acceptable middle form: key-only root, no
   password login.

#### Not done here (still deferred)

Hardening this iteration is **host-level, as root**. The privilege-drop —
an unprivileged `atlas` user, the Firecracker **jailer**, and the Firecracker
**AppArmor** profile — is a larger, breaking change and remains on the
[roadmap](./09-roadmap.md), along with `/tmp` `/dev/shm` mount hardening,
`auditd`, and surfacing "reboot pending" after an unattended security update.

#### Guest serial console disabled

The other half of the Firecracker doc's "8250 Serial Device" / "Log files"
guidance is a per-VM concern, applied where the VM config is built
([`provision-vm.py`](../scripts/provision-vm.py)) rather than here: every VM
boots with `8250.nr_uarts=0` and **without** `console=ttyS0`. The 8250 serial
device is tied to Firecracker's stdout, and a guest with serial access can drive
unbounded host log/storage growth. Disabling it at boot (plus the host-side **FC
log rotation** in the table above) bounds both ends. The guest can technically
re-enable the device after boot, so the bounded-storage half is the load-bearing
mitigation. **Consequence:** `firecracker.log` no longer carries guest
kernel/console output — debug a misbehaving guest from inside it over SSH, not
from the host log (see the troubleshooting note in
[06-networking.md](./06-networking.md)).

#### What we deliberately skip (and won't re-litigate)

The selection axis is *does this protect a Firecracker host without breaking it,
in a way we can explain in one line and maintain* — not "what a CIS scan scores".
So we **do not** run the full `usg`/CIS profile (it sets the three deviations
wrong and drags in a long tail of PAM/password-policy, AIDE, auditd, and banner
controls that are pure box-ticking on a headless, key-only-root, machine-driven
host); `usg` is at most an audit *reporter*, never the apply mechanism. We also
skip the Firecracker doc's **host hardware/boot-cmdline** items — `nosmt`
(halves a 2-vCPU droplet; a multi-tenant-with-hostile-neighbors concern),
ECC/TRR memory and early microcode (provider procurement), and cgroup/`quiet
loglevel` GRUB tuning (don't fit an idempotent re-runnable bootstrap). These are
provider- or tenancy-level concerns that sit above Atlas; revisit only with a
concrete need. (The guest-side serial/log items from the same doc *are* applied
— see just above — because they are VM-config and host-storage, not host-cmdline
tuning.)

### Files that must already be on the server

The bootstrap script does not itself fetch the systemd-invoked hooks, the
systemd units, or the shared package — uploading them is the caller's job, so
that we keep the contents of `atlas/scripts/` as the single source of truth.
These are **durable** state (they live under `/var/lib/atlas/bin` and
`/etc/systemd/system`, not the per-Task `/tmp/atlas` staging), so
`Server.bootstrap()` places them directly via `upload_files`, not through the
per-Task sidecar mechanism. Before running `bootstrap-server.py`, the caller
uploads (see `_BOOTSTRAP_UPLOADS` + `_bootstrap_uploads()` in `server.py`):

- `scripts/host-pyproject.toml` → `/var/lib/atlas/bin/pyproject.toml`
- `scripts/install.sh` → `/var/lib/atlas/bin/install.sh` (the controller pipes
  this over SSH right after the upload to create the venv — shipped durably so the
  controller has a local copy and no public URL is needed)
- `scripts/vm-network-up.py` → `/var/lib/atlas/bin/vm-network-up.py`
- `scripts/vm-network-down.py` → `/var/lib/atlas/bin/vm-network-down.py`
- `scripts/vm-disk-up.py` → `/var/lib/atlas/bin/vm-disk-up.py`
- `scripts/vm-restore.py` → `/var/lib/atlas/bin/vm-restore.py`
- `scripts/sshpiper/atlas` → `/tmp/sshpiper-atlas`
- `scripts/systemd/firecracker-vm@.service` → `/etc/systemd/system/firecracker-vm@.service`
- `scripts/systemd/atlas-pool.service` → `/etc/systemd/system/atlas-pool.service`
- `scripts/systemd/sshpiper.service` → `/etc/systemd/system/sshpiper.service`
- every `scripts/lib/atlas/*.py` (test files skipped) → `/var/lib/atlas/bin/atlas/*.py`

The `pyproject.toml` makes `/var/lib/atlas/bin` a pip-installable project: it is
the manifest `uv pip install /var/lib/atlas/bin` consumes (its wheel package root
is `atlas`, the flat durable layout, distinct from the dev
[`scripts/pyproject.toml`](../scripts/pyproject.toml)). The systemd hooks
(`vm-network-up.py`, `vm-network-down.py`, `vm-disk-up.py`, `vm-restore.py`) are
invoked by the unit as `/var/lib/atlas/venv/bin/python <path> %i` (a positional VM
uuid, not Task `--flags`) and `import` the durable package next to them; the
package (`/var/lib/atlas/bin/atlas/`) replaces the old durable `lvm.sh` shell
library. `/var/lib/atlas/venv/bin/python` is the **Atlas venv python** (see *The
Atlas interpreter and CLI* below), not the host's `/usr/bin/python3` —
`atlas-pool.service` runs under it too.

The `Server.bootstrap()` Python method orchestrates this:

```
1. open ssh connection (via `connection_for_server`)
2. upload_files: the durable hooks, both systemd units, the atlas package, and
   install.sh (mkdir of parent directories happens inside upload_files)
3. run install.sh over SSH (`bash /var/lib/atlas/bin/install.sh`) — creates the
   uv venv + `atlas` console script and runs the deep sanity gate. This must run
   BEFORE the bootstrap Task (which now runs as `atlas bootstrap-server` on the
   venv). Skipped for a Fake server, exactly as the upload is.
4. run_task(server=..., script="bootstrap-server",
            variables={"FIRECRACKER_VERSION": ..., "ARCHITECTURE": ...})
   — the ssh exec (`atlas bootstrap-server --flags`) happens inside run_task.
5. parse the ATLAS_RESULT= line from stdout into Server fields
   (firecracker_version, jailer_version, kernel_version, architecture); the
   line also carries python_version, which is read for the bootstrap log but
   deliberately NOT written to a Server field (derived state). The same JSON is
   also persisted on the host at /var/lib/atlas/bootstrap.json.
6. save the Server row.
```

This is one Task: `bootstrap-server`. The pre-copy + install.sh steps are not a Task,
it's plumbing, and its commands are not interesting individually. They do
appear on stderr of the task because Python tasks echo each command (the
`set -x` equivalent the `atlas._run.run` wrapper prints).

## Provisioning a server end-to-end

`Atlas Settings.provision_server(...)` is whitelisted and called from the
**Provision Server** button on the Atlas Settings form. It calls the active
provider implementation (`atlas.get_provider().provision(request)`) in the web
request, then enqueues `finish_provisioning` to run `describe()` (DigitalOcean)
or no-op (Self-Managed) and run bootstrap.

`finish_provisioning` is enqueued (`frappe.enqueue(..., queue="long")`),
not run inline. The button returns the moment the `Server` row is
inserted — a `bench worker` must be running for the row to leave
`Pending`. With no worker, the Server stays `Pending` forever and there
is no UI signal that anything is wrong. The same applies to
`Virtual Machine Image.sync_to_server` (see [08-images.md](./08-images.md)).

The operator picks a `title` (the user-facing label); the Server row's
`name` is a UUID assigned by `Server.autoname()`. The `provision_server`
controller returns the new UUID — call sites that route to the form
should use the returned name, not the title.

### Adopting an already-provisioned server

A Server row may be created by **Provision Server** (above) *or adopted*
from a box the vendor account already holds. The **Discover Servers**
button on the `Atlas Settings` form — sibling of **Refresh Catalog**, same
"ask the vendor what exists, reconcile into Atlas" mental model — drives
this:

- `Atlas Settings.discover_servers()` (whitelisted, read-only) calls
  `provider.list_servers()`, the unfiltered list of every server in the
  account/region (not the tag-filtered list the e2e pre-sweep uses — a
  box built outside Atlas carries no `atlas` tag). It flags each one
  `imported=true|false` by deduping against existing
  `Server.provider_resource_id`. The picker dialog renders the list;
  already-modeled servers are disabled and badged so a re-run can't
  double-insert.
- `Atlas Settings.import_servers(resource_ids)` (the dialog posts
  `resource_ids` as a JSON *string* — parsed with `frappe.parse_json`)
  re-resolves each picked id authoritatively via `describe()` — the same
  path `finish_provisioning` trusts — and inserts a Server row through
  the shared `_apply_describe_result` mapping. An already-modeled id is
  skipped, never double-inserted.

Imported rows land **`Pending`**, never `Active`: the box's origin is
unknown (hand-built, or an old Atlas box) and Atlas has not bootstrapped
it — the durable scripts, units, and version fields are absent or
unverified. From `Pending` the operator clicks **Bootstrap** (a box
built outside Atlas) or **Re-bootstrap** (one Atlas built earlier) to
reach `Active`, exactly as a freshly-provisioned row does. There is
deliberately no "mark Active without bootstrapping" shortcut — that
would let a row claim `Active` while unable to host a VM. The import
dialog warns that a box built outside Atlas may not match Atlas's RAID-1
/ LVM-pool layout, so Bootstrap can legitimately fail on disk discovery.

`SelfManagedProvider.list_servers()` returns `()` — there is no vendor
to ask, so adoption of a self-managed box stays the manual **Provision
Server** dialog where the operator types the IPs.

### The Provider interface boundary

The controller does not know which vendor it is talking to. It builds a
`ProvisionRequest` dataclass from the dialog inputs and hands it to
`atlas.get_provider().provision(request)`. The result is a
`ProvisionResult` carrying `provider_resource_id`, `ready`, and
optionally a `ServerNetworking` block. Two contracts the interface
enforces:

- `provision()` must return within ~30 seconds. Long-running vendor
  creates (Scaleway Elastic Metal, AWS spot) return `ready=False` with
  a placeholder id; the worker polls `describe()` until ready.
- `describe()` is the authoritative source for Server fields after
  provision. The worker writes `size`, `image`, IPs,
  `ipv6_virtual_machine_range`, and `provider_metadata` from its result
  — `provision()`'s output is treated as a hint, not the truth.

See [01-architecture.md § Provider abstraction](./01-architecture.md#provider-abstraction) and
[llm/plan/provider-abstraction.md](../llm/plan/provider-abstraction.md)
for the full interface.

### DigitalOcean

Signature: `provision_server(title, size=None, image=None)`. The region
is fixed at `DigitalOcean Settings.region` (Atlas is single-region);
the dialog has no region field, and the controller throws if a request
carries one. Sync for the cheap part, async for the slow part:

```
1. Validate no existing Server row carries this title.
2. atlas.get_provider().provision(ProvisionRequest(
       title, size, image, ssh_key=atlas.get_ssh_key(), networking=DUAL_STACK
   )) → ProvisionResult(provider_resource_id=droplet_id, ready=False, ...)
3. Insert a Server row with status = "Pending", a UUID name, the title,
   provider_resource_id from the result. size / image left empty —
   describe() will fill them on the worker side.
4. frappe.enqueue("...finish_provisioning", queue="long", server_name=<uuid>).
5. Return the new UUID name immediately.
```

The `finish_provisioning(server_name)` worker:

```
1. Load Server.
2. identifier = Server.provider_resource_id or Server.name
   — Self-Managed has no vendor-side id; the worker passes the row's
     UUID so describe() can look it up.
3. result = wait_until_ready(provider, identifier, timeout=600s)
   — polls provider.describe() at 5s intervals until ready=True.
4. Apply result.networking to Server: ipv4_address, ipv6_address,
   ipv6_prefix, ipv6_virtual_machine_range (DO: /124 carved from /64).
5. Apply result.size, result.image, result.provider_metadata.
   Empty size / image are skipped (Self-Managed returns "") so
   operator-entered values are not clobbered.
6. status = "Bootstrapping". Save.
7. wait_for_ssh(connection_for_server(server), timeout=300s).
8. server.bootstrap()  — synchronous inside the worker; no nested enqueue.
9. On success: status = "Active". On any exception: status = "Broken"
   and re-raise so the Task row carries the failure.
```

The worker takes only `server_name` (the row's UUID); the droplet id
lives on the row, so re-running the worker (idempotency check, retry)
does not need the caller to remember it.

### Self-Managed

Signature: `provision_server(title, ipv4_address, ipv6_address,
ipv6_prefix, ipv6_virtual_machine_range)`. There is no droplet to create
and nothing to wait for — the host already exists. The controller
builds a `ProvisionRequest` with `prebuilt_networking` populated and
calls `provision()`:

```
1. Validate no existing Server row carries this title.
2. atlas.get_provider().provision(ProvisionRequest(
       title, prebuilt_networking=ServerNetworking(ipv4, ipv6, prefix, range), ...
   )) → ProvisionResult(provider_resource_id="", ready=True, networking=...)
3. Insert a Server row with status = "Pending", a UUID name, the title,
   the operator-supplied IPv4 / IPv6 fields, empty provider_resource_id,
   empty size / image.
4. frappe.enqueue("...finish_provisioning", queue="long", server_name=<uuid>).
5. Return the new UUID name immediately.
```

`finish_provisioning` on a Self-Managed server: the
`SelfManagedProvider.describe()` returns the row's existing networking
unchanged with `ready=True`, so the polling loop exits on the first
iteration with no field updates. Then:

```
1. status = "Bootstrapping". Save.
2. wait_for_ssh(connection_for_server(server), timeout=300s).
3. server.bootstrap().
4. On success: status = "Active". On any exception: status = "Broken".
```

The worker does not branch on provider type — both paths run the same
`wait_until_ready → apply networking → bootstrap` sequence. The
vendor-specific behavior lives entirely inside `provider.describe()`.

### Common: failure handling

A `Broken` server can be re-bootstrapped by clicking **Bootstrap** on the
form because `bootstrap-server.py` is idempotent. For DigitalOcean the
droplet is left intact for the operator to delete in DO if they choose.
For Self-Managed the host is the operator's problem; Atlas never touches
it beyond SSH.

### Idempotency

Every action is idempotent:

- `apt-get install -y` is idempotent (and waits out the first-boot apt-lock
  race before running — see step 2).
- The Firecracker + jailer install is gated on `firecracker --version` and
  `jailer --version` (re-run installs either if absent or wrong-versioned).
- File writes use `install -m mode -T` (atomic, overwrite). The hardening
  drop-ins (sysctl.d, sshd_config.d, modprobe.d, apt.conf.d) are all written
  this way, so a re-bootstrap rewrites identical bytes — a clean no-op.
- nftables creates are guarded with `nft list ... || nft add ...`.
- `sshd -t` validates the drop-in before `systemctl reload ssh`; `swapoff -a`
  and the KSM write are no-ops when already off.
- `mkdir -p` and `systemctl daemon-reload` are naturally idempotent.

Re-running `Bootstrap` is the recovery path. There is no separate "repair"
mode and there will not be one.

### Pinned versions

`FIRECRACKER_VERSION = v1.16.0`. To bump, edit the constant in
`atlas/atlas/doctype/server/server.py` and re-run `Bootstrap` on every
server. The script is idempotent so re-running is the only thing the
operator does. **Warm snapshots are tied to the Firecracker version** —
`host_signature()` folds it into the snapshot-restore compatibility check,
so bumping invalidates every golden warm snapshot baked under the old
version; re-bake them. The full inventory of every pinned binary, image,
and package lives in [spec/23-supply-chain.md](23-supply-chain.md).

`ARCHITECTURE = x86_64`. `aarch64` is on the roadmap.

### Failure modes

| Failure                          | Resulting Server status | Operator action               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| SSH never comes up               | `Pending`               | Investigate the droplet on DO.|
| `/dev/kvm` missing               | `Broken`                | Wrong droplet size — recreate.|
| `apt-get` fails                  | `Broken`                | Re-run Bootstrap. (First-boot apt-lock race is waited out in step 2.) |
| Firecracker download fails       | `Broken`                | Re-run Bootstrap.             |
| Architecture mismatch            | `Broken`                | Wrong droplet image — recreate.|

There is no automatic retry. The escape hatch is the same code path: click
`Bootstrap` again. The Task list shows every attempt.

## Why a shell script (and not pyinfra)

Read [04-tasks.md](./04-tasks.md). Short version: pyinfra's idea — declarative
ops desugared to commands per host — is good. The implementation is too much
machinery for a building block. A shell script is a single file, readable
top-to-bottom, and runs in one process on the server. When pain forces a
better abstraction, we will reach for it then, and we will likely build a
small subset of pyinfra ourselves instead of taking the dependency. See the
[roadmap](./09-roadmap.md).
