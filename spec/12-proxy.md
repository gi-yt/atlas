# The reverse proxy

A TLS-terminating reverse proxy that fronts many Frappe sites. Each site is a
subdomain of a regional wildcard (`*.<region>.frappe.dev`); each subdomain maps
to exactly one site VM, dialed over public IPv6 on port 80 (plaintext). The map
changes constantly and must update **without reloading nginx**. Atlas is the
source of truth and reconciles each proxy's live map over SSH.

## The shape

- **The proxy is an ordinary Atlas Virtual Machine** — operator-owned, marked
  `is_proxy` with a `region` ([02-doctypes.md](./02-doctypes.md#virtual-machine)).
  No infrastructure-VM tier: it is invisible to the user SPA by ownership, and
  inherits the standard Firecracker jail + per-VM netns + cgroup caps as its
  sandbox. It runs the self-built nginx + Lua stack ([`proxy/`](../proxy)) and
  carries an attached `public_ipv4` (the inbound-v4 primitive,
  [06-networking.md](./06-networking.md#ipv4-ingress-reserved-ip)) so it can
  terminate v4 **and** v6 on `:443`.
- **2–3 proxy VMs per region** behind the one regional wildcard (DNS
  round-robin over their v4 + v6), for resiliency and zero-downtime rolling
  updates. Each proxy is independent and holds the **whole** regional map.
- **The live map** is a `lua_shared_dict` inside each proxy guest (the in-process
  source of truth), dumped to a sorted, pretty-printed `map.json` read only at
  start. A map change is an atomic dict write — **zero reload**.

## Desired state: the Subdomain DocType

One [`Subdomain`](./02-doctypes.md#subdomain) row per routing entry: `subdomain`
(unique) → `virtual_machine` (the site VM) → `address` (the VM's `/128`,
denormalized) → `region` + `active`. Standalone and linked (the Reserved IP
idiom), **not** a child grid on a proxy — every proxy holds the whole regional
map, so ownership is per region.

The desired map for a region is `map_for_region(region)` = `{subdomain: address}`
for every active subdomain in the region. Every proxy VM in the region serves
that same full map.

## Control plane: Atlas → guest

`atlas/atlas/proxy.py` is the controller side. It is **not** a host Task (which
stages a script onto a Server and runs it there): it runs on the controller and
SSHes **into the guest** — the second SSH target type,
`connection_for_guest(vm)` ([04-tasks.md](./04-tasks.md#how-it-runs)),
reaching the VM's `/128` as `root` with the same Atlas key already in the guest's
`authorized_keys`. The guest's admin API is a **unix socket only**
(`/run/nginx/admin.sock`); SSH-to-the-guest is the only way to reach it,
and the socket's file permissions are the gate.

- **`canonical_json(map)`** — the one canonical serialization: sorted keys,
  2-space indent, one key per line, trailing newline. **Byte-identical** to the
  guest's `persist.lua` output, so the reconcile "in sync?" check is a plain
  string compare, not a semantic diff.
- **`reconcile_proxy(vm)` / `reconcile_region(region)`** — for each proxy VM,
  read its live `/map` over the admin socket, byte-compare against the canonical
  desired map, and bulk-declarative `POST /sync` the full map (streamed to the
  guest `curl --data-binary @-` over SSH stdin) on drift. Idempotent,
  self-healing, **rebuild-safe** (a fresh proxy's empty dict refills on the next
  reconcile). A proxy that can't be reached is recorded as a failed Task and
  **skipped** — one wedged guest never wedges the loop; the others still serve.
- **`push_cert(vm, fullchain, privkey)`** — drop the regional wildcard
  cert/key into the guest's per-region cert dir (private key via `tee` from
  stdin, never in an argv) and reload nginx. Cert pushes are rare, so a reload is
  fine here (unlike map changes). The cert is pushed, never baked into the image,
  so one proxy image serves any region and a renewal is a re-push, not a rebuild.

- **`build_proxy(vm)`** — turn a freshly-provisioned Ubuntu guest into a proxy:
  upload the committed [`proxy/`](../proxy) tree over the same guest-SSH path and
  run [`proxy/build.sh`](../proxy/build.sh) **inside** the guest (compiling nginx +
  Lua from pinned sources), then write the VM's `region` and start the unit. This
  is the controller side of "build inside the guest" (*Build & roll = VM
  lifecycle* below) and the same
  byte-identical stack the compose release gate exercises (the gate's Dockerfile
  runs the same `build.sh`). Idempotent, so it doubles as the re-bake verb. The
  operator snapshots the built VM; that snapshot is the rollable proxy image.

Each guest operation is recorded as a `Task` row (`script` = `proxy-build` /
`proxy-sync` / `proxy-push-cert`, with the proxy VM) for the operator's audit
trail, the same row shape as every host Task.

## Build & roll = VM lifecycle

The proxy is built the Atlas-native way (no custom rootfs, no host service):
provision an ordinary VM from stock Ubuntu, then `build_proxy(vm)` SSHes in,
uploads the [`proxy/`](../proxy) tree, and runs
[`proxy/build.sh`](../proxy/build.sh) inside the guest (compiles nginx 1.30.2 +
OpenResty `luajit2` + `lua-nginx-module` + NDK + resty-core/lrucache + lua-cjson +
headers-more from pinned sources, installs the stack + the three Lua modules +
the guest unit), then **snapshot** it — that snapshot is the reusable "proxy
image". Install / update / roll / rollback are the existing VM lifecycle verbs
(provision / rebuild / snapshot / clone), rolled one proxy at a time so DNS keeps
the others serving — a zero-downtime rolling update.

The nginx image's behavior is the **image-level release gate**: the
docker-compose harness under [`proxy/test/`](../proxy/test) exercises the same
`conf/` + `lua/` the in-guest build installs. Beyond the happy path (routing,
remap-no-reload, branded 404, bulk `/sync`, canonical-JSON byte-match,
restart-reload-from-`map.json`, HTTP→HTTPS, HTTP/2, socket.io upgrade) it pins the
subtler behaviors and failure modes — forwarded-header/query fidelity, security
headers on the branded page, the admin method/route matrix, bad-address and
misbehaving-upstream fail-clean, corrupt-`map.json` boot, the dump debounce + its
durability window, concurrent-read atomicity — plus latency/timing/scale guards
(routing overhead, streaming first-byte, TLS resumption, a concurrency soak, a
10k-entry map). `test_proxy.py` + `test_build.py` + `test_latency.py`, all green.
Nothing is installed on the dev host.

## Host-bound facts — the `proxy_vm` Atlas e2e

These prove what only a real droplet can. They are wired as a single e2e use
case, [`atlas/tests/e2e/use_cases/proxy_vm.py`](../atlas/tests/e2e/use_cases/proxy_vm.py),
registered in `run_all` / `run_all_smoke` and run on the shared bootstrapped
droplet. The controller logic underneath each is unit-covered in milliseconds
(`atlas/atlas/test_proxy.py`: canonical JSON, the reconcile diff, the proxy-tree
enumeration; `scripts/lib/atlas/test_reserved_ip_nat.py`: the host NAT math). The
e2e itself needs a billable droplet + a real reserved IP, so it is run on the
operator's turn (`bench --site atlas.tests.local execute
atlas.tests.e2e.use_cases.proxy_vm.run_smoke`), not in the unit suite.

- **Build inside the guest** — `build_proxy` SSHes a fresh Ubuntu VM, uploads the
  `proxy/` tree, and runs `build.sh`; nginx + Lua compiles and the unit comes up.
  (A proxy guest is reached two ways — host-side probes carry the e2e ephemeral
  key, the control plane reaches it via `connection_for_guest` with the
  Atlas-settings key — so the e2e provisions the proxy trusting **both** keys. In
  production the proxy image bakes the Atlas key, the same as every VM.)
- **guest-SSH map sync end-to-end** — `reconcile_proxy` syncs the live map over
  SSH-to-the-guest; the e2e reads `/map` back and asserts it equals the canonical
  desired map byte-for-byte.
- **inbound-:80 to a site from the proxy's vantage** — the public-v6 south-side
  release gate that had never been tested
  ([06-networking.md](./06-networking.md), and the public-v6 hop under
  *Accepted limitations* below): from inside
  the proxy guest, reach a stand-in site VM's `[v6]:80` (the exact
  `proxy_pass http://[<site-v6>]:80` hop). A site's `:80` is reachable by anyone
  on the v6 internet; a future per-VM firewall must scope it to the proxies and
  must not drop the proxy hop.
- **inbound-:443 reachability** — attach a real reserved IPv4 to the proxy, push
  the wildcard cert, and from **off the droplet** (the controller, over the public
  v4 internet) hit `https://<sub>.<region>.frappe.dev` (`--resolve` to the
  reserved v4, `-k` for the self-signed test cert) and get the site's response
  back through the proxy. `:443` is the proxy's first real listener (the attach
  primitive's e2e was previously proven only for SSH/`:22`).
- **rolling rebuild** — stop the proxy, snapshot it, rebuild from that snapshot,
  re-push cert, re-sync map, and confirm it serves again. In production DNS keeps
  the other 2–3 proxies serving while one rolls; the e2e rolls the single proxy
  and re-verifies the front door.

TLS **grade** (A+) is the one image-gate row not automated (needs a real cert /
`testssl.sh`), so it is a manual/D check.

## Why these decisions

The spec records *what* is true; these are the structural choices and the
alternatives they beat, kept so a future change knows what it is overturning.

1. **The proxy runs inside an Atlas VM, not a host service.** An earlier draft
   ran it as a host-level service on a dedicated proxy *node* (its own exported
   rootfs, `RootDirectory=` chroot, systemd hardening drop-ins). Superseded: the
   VM is the universal building block, so the proxy inherits Atlas's lifecycle,
   jailer, cgroup, image/rebuild, and snapshot machinery for free. The VM **is**
   the sandbox; there is no bespoke hardening stack. (The old host-service
   `systemd/` + `install.py`/`update.py` were never built.)
2. **2–3 proxy VMs per region — dedicated, not co-located per host.** Drivers:
   resiliency, rollover, rolling update. The rejected alternative — co-locating a
   proxy with the sites it fronts to make the south hop host-local — would have
   retired the public-v6 caveat (*Accepted limitations* below) but lost the
   dedicated-fleet resiliency. We took the caveat.
3. **Inbound is the real goal — a VM can attach one public IPv4.** This is the
   inbound mirror of the existing egress NAT44, gated to Atlas-owned VMs today.
   On DO it is a reserved IP attached to the *droplet* and host-side 1:1-NATed to
   the guest (DNAT in, SNAT out, same `inet atlas` table) — *not* routed the way
   v6 is, because DO delivers the reserved IP via an **anchor IP** and never ARPs
   for the reserved IP on the link, so the v6 proxy-NDP + `/32`-route recipe has
   nothing to bind to ([06-networking.md](./06-networking.md#ipv4-ingress-reserved-ip)).
   The proxy is the primitive's first user; general tenant inbound v4 is a
   deliberate later step ([09-roadmap.md](./09-roadmap.md)).
4. **No infrastructure-VM tier.** The proxy holds the wildcard private key and
   terminates TLS for the region — a higher trust tier than a tenant site — but
   we deliberately do **not** model that as a new DocType. It is an ordinary
   operator-owned `Virtual Machine`, invisible to the user SPA by ownership.
   Accepted risk: it can be Terminated from Desk like any VM (mitigated by
   running 2–3; a terminate-guard is an additive follow-up, see
   [09-roadmap.md](./09-roadmap.md)).
5. **Atlas SSHes into the guest.** A second SSH target type (guest, reaching the
   VM's `/128`) alongside the existing host-root path, used for both map sync and
   cert push. The guest admin API is a unix socket only — SSH-to-the-guest is the
   only way to reach it; socket file perms are the gate. No agent on the guest.
6. **The map is bulk-declarative reconcile, not event sourcing.** Atlas is the
   source of truth; each proxy's dict is a cache. Both sides emit the *same*
   canonical JSON (sorted keys, 2-space indent), so "in sync?" is a byte compare.
   Per-entry PUT/DELETE exist for low-latency single changes; the periodic full
   `/sync` is the backstop.

## Accepted limitations

Carried into the release gate, true today:

- **The proxy→site south hop is over the public IPv6 internet** (proxies and
  sites are generally on different hosts; there is no private fabric). A site's
  `:80` is therefore reachable by anyone on the v6 internet, not just the proxy.
  Scoping that exposure is an active security gap — the south-side firewall in
  [09-roadmap.md](./09-roadmap.md). The proxy is path-agnostic, so a future
  private fabric (ULA `fc00::/7`) changes only the address in the map.
- **One reserved IP per host, for now** — the DO anchor is per-droplet, so the L3
  DNAT can't distinguish two reserved IPs on one host. Fine at one proxy VM per
  host; multi-reserved-IP is a later step.
